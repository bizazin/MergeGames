## Features
### Boss Fight
A thrilling feature where players can challenge powerful bosses. Defeating these bosses provides players with unique rewards and adds an extra layer of strategy to the merge gameplay.

### Player Profile Refactoring to ECS
I've refactored the player profile using the Entity-Component-System (ECS) pattern. This not only makes the game more efficient but also provides a more modular and scalable structure.

### News and Polls
Stay updated with the latest happenings in the game. Players can now access in-game news and also participate in polls, influencing the future direction of the game.

### Maintenance Work
In a team of 7-8 people, I've been instrumental in:

• **Bug Fixes**: Addressing and resolving numerous bugs to ensure smooth gameplay.

• **UI Layout**: The whole process of layout from scratch to the finished window in the game, redesigning and optimizing various game windows for a better user experience.

• **Endpoints for Server Interaction** and so on
