**Disclaimer:** This repository showcases only the specific parts of the 'Merge Games' project that I personally contributed to. For confidentiality and proprietary reasons, certain code segments have been stripped down or modified. The intention is to provide an understanding of the overall essence without revealing sensitive or detailed information.

Welcome to the central repository where I've documented and showcased the main features and maintenance work done for a series of crypto merge games. While the games are identical in gameplay, they offer a diverse visual experience ranging from merging [cats](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.soul.merge.cat.cute.simulator.adventure&hl=en&gl=US), [dragons](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dragons.tokens.crypto&hl=en&gl=US), [foxes](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.realis.fox.nft.token&hl=en&gl=US), [doges](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=elon.musk.doge.meme.blockchain.coin.twit&hl=en&gl=US), and more.

## Introduction
This repository serves as a testament to the continuous improvement and dedication I've put into the crypto merge games. Whether you're a developer, a player, or just someone curious about my work, you'll find valuable insights into the features and fixes I've implemented over the past year.

## Features
### Boss Fight
A thrilling feature where players can challenge powerful bosses. Defeating these bosses provides players with unique rewards and adds an extra layer of strategy to the merge gameplay.

### Player Profile Refactoring to ECS
I've refactored the player profile using the Entity-Component-System (ECS) pattern. This not only makes the game more efficient but also provides a more modular and scalable structure.

### News and Polls
Stay updated with the latest happenings in the game. Players can now access in-game news and also participate in polls, influencing the future direction of the game.

### Maintenance Work
In a team of 7-8 people, I've been instrumental in:

• **Bug Fixes**: Addressing and resolving numerous bugs to ensure smooth gameplay.

• **UI Layout**: The whole process of layout from scratch to the finished window in the game, redesigning and optimizing various game windows for a better user experience.

• **Endpoints for Server Interaction** and so on
