# Player Profile System Refactoring Documentation
## Introduction
This README provides a detailed overview of the diagrams created to visualize the refactoring process of our player profile system. Originally, player profile information (e.g., username, email) was intertwined with various game components like units, hangars, and working units. The objective of this refactoring effort is to separate these components, transitioning from an OOP-based system to an ECS (Entity Component System) approach.

## Diagrams Overview
For each major part of the game - units, hangars, working units, and player profile info - there are two diagrams:

### 1. Old System (OOP-based Approach)

Represents the previous state, highlighting how data and operations related to these game parts were previously organized.
### 2. New System (ECS-based Approach)

Demonstrates the post-refactoring structure, underscoring the clear separation and the modular nature achieved using ECS.
Specifically, you will find pairs of diagrams for:

• Units (Old)

• Hangars (Old)

• Working Units (Old & New)

• Player Profile Info (New)
